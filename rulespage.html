		  <h3>Scoring</h3>
		  <p>Tennis has a different point system than most sports. Before we go into detail, here is your guide to scoring a game:</p>
		  <ul>
		  	<li>0 points= Love</li>
		  	<li>1 point = 15</li>
		  	<li>2 points= 30</li>
		  	<li>3 points= 40</li>
		  	<li>Tied score= All</li>
		  	<li>40-40 = Deuce</li>
		  	<li>Server wins deuce point = Ad-In</li>
		  	<li>Receiver wins deuce point = Ad-Out</li>
		  </ul>
		  <h3>Who wins?</h3>
		  <p>In order to win the game, a player must win at least four points. If you are up 40-30, 40-15 or 40-love, and win one more point, you win the game. If the score is tied in a game or set, you use the term “all” when announcing the score. For example, if you and your opponent have both won two points in the game, the score would be 30-all.</p>
		  <h3>Switching sides</h3>
		  <p>Players or teams switch ends of the court on odd games. This means that after the first game is complete, they switch sides, as well as every two games after that.</p>
		  <h3>Game, Set, Match</h3>
		  <ul>
		  	<li><b>Points:</b> Points are scored as 0 (love), 15, 30, 40, and then game</li>
		  	<li><b>Games:</b> The first player to win four points, with a two-point lead, wins the game</li>
		  	<li><b>Sets:</b> A player wins a set by winning at least six games and having a two-game lead</li>
		  	<li><b>Tiebreaker:</b> If the score is tied at 6-6, a tiebreaker is played, where the first player to reach seven points with a two-point lead wins the set</li>
		  	<li><b>Matches:</b> Matches are typically played as best-of-three or best-of-five sets, depending on the tournament</li>
		  </ul>
